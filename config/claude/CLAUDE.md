## Core Principles
- NEVER use emoji, or unicode that emulates emoji (e.g. ✓, ✗).
- MUST avoid including redundant comments which are tautological or self-demonstating (e.g. cases where it is easily parsable what the code does at a glance so the comment does)
- MUST use modern tools for searching such as `ast-grep` (prefered) or `rg` instead of `grep` and `fd` instead of `find`.
